# AI-Waste-Sorter
Improper waste segregation causes high recycling contamination, sending usable materials to landfills. This project will use a CNN for Image Classification (Sustainability theme) to identify waste items from an image. It will then instruct the user on correct sorting, promoting the 'green skill' of recycling and reducing landfill waste.
